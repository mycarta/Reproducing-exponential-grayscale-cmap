# Reproducing an exponential grayscale cmap

What I learned in the process of reproducing [Figure 1](https://images.app.goo.gl/aGeNcomJVExzwYJs8) from the paper "Perception of visual information: The role of colour in seismic interpretation", by Froner et alii, First Break, March 2013.

And giving some general advice for how to go about it:

- Get permission. Ask for permission to use the data, if the data is not open, or if uncertain; if it's only a figure, ask for permission to show the original with the reproduced one
- Do the math. Define, study and test the equations / functions and other computations necessary to replicate the figure
- Get the plots right. Figure out the specific plotting stuff to replicate the figure (and improve it if necessary)
- Extra work. Go further, add interactivity for others to experiment with it
- Test the results. Test on the data that come with the paper, if possible, or other data (model and real)
- Pay back. Share your results. It with a permissive license, ideally CC-BY
