# Reproducing an exponential grayscale cmap

This repository stems from my experience reproducing [Figure 1](https://images.app.goo.gl/aGeNcomJVExzwYJs8) from the Reference paper, and and my desire to give some advice on the reproducibility process.

You can work through the entire workflow in the notebook [How to make exponential greayscale](https://github.com/mycarta/Reproducing-exponential-grayscale-cmap/blob/master/How_to_make_exponetial_grayscale.ipynb)

- Step 1. Get permission. 
- Step 2. Figure out the math. 
- Step 3. Get the plots right.
- Step 4. Test the results on some data.
- Step 5. Do some extra work (i.e. improve the plots, or add interactivity).
- Step 6. Pay it forward. Share your results with a permissive license, ideally CC-BY. 

A full article will appear as a chapter in the upcoming book "52 things you should know about geocomputing, to be published by [Agile Libre](https://www.agilelibre.com.
