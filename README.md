# Reproducing an exponential grayscale cmap


What I learned while in reproducing Figure 1 from the paper "Perception of visual information: The role of colour in seismic interpretation", by Froner et alii,First Break, March 2013.

And giving some general advice for how to go about it:


- Get permission. Get permissions if data is not open, or if uncertain, and if it's only a figure, get permission to show the original too.
- Do the math. Define, study and test the equations / functions and other computations necessary to replicate the figure
- Get the plots right. Figure out the specific plotting stuff to replicate the figure (and improve it if necessary)
- Extra work. Go further, add interactivity for others to experiment with it
- Test the results. Test on the data that come with the paper, if possible, or other data (model and real)
- Pay back. Share your results. It with a permissive license, ideally CC-BY
