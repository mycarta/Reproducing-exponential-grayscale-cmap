# Reproducing an exponential grayscale cmap


What I learned while in reproducing Figure 1 from the paper "Perception of visual information: The role of colour in seismic interpretation", by Froner et alii,First Break, March 2013.

And giving some general advice for how to go about it:

Get permissions if data is not open, or if uncertain
Define, study and test the equations / functions necessary to replicate the figure
Figure out the specific plotting stuff to replicate the figure, and even improve it
Extra: go further, add interactivity for others to experiment with it
Test on the data that come with the paper, if possible, or other data (model and real)
Share it with a permissive license, ideally CC-BY
